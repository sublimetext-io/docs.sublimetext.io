============
Key Bindings
============

Key bindings map key presses to commands.


File Format
***********

Key bindings are stored in ``.sublime-keymap`` files
and defined in JSON.
Keymap files may be located anywhere in a package.


Naming Keymap Files
--------------------

Any keymap named ``Default.sublime-keymap``
will always be applied in all platforms.

Additionally, each platform
can optionally have its own keymap:

* ``Default (Windows).sublime-keymap``
* ``Default (OSX).sublime-keymap``
* ``Default (Linux).sublime-keymap``

Sublime Text will ignore any ``.sublime-keymap`` file
whose name doesn't follow the patterns just described.


Structure of a Key Binding
--------------------------

Keymaps are arrays of key bindings.
These are all valid elements in a key binding:

``keys``
   An array of case-sensitive keys.
   Modifiers can be specified
   with the ``+`` sign.
   You can build chords
   by adding elements to the array
   (for example, ``["ctrl+k","ctrl+j"]``).
   Ambiguous chords are resolved
   with a timeout.

``command``
   Name of the command to be executed.

``args``
   Dictionary of arguments
   to be passed to ``command``.
   Keys must be names
   of parameters to ``command``.

``context``
   Array of conditions
   that determine a particular *context*.
   All conditions must evaluate to `true`
   for the context to be active.
   See :ref:`context-reference` below
   for more information.

Here's an example:

.. code-block:: json

   { "keys": ["shift+enter"], "command": "insert_snippet", "args": {"contents": "\n\t$0\n"}, "context":
      [
         { "key": "setting.auto_indent", "operator": "equal", "operand": true },
         { "key": "selection_empty", "operator": "equal", "operand": true, "match_all": true },
         { "key": "preceding_text", "operator": "regex_contains", "operand": "\\{$", "match_all": true },
         { "key": "following_text", "operator": "regex_contains", "operand": "^\\}", "match_all": true }
      ]
   }


.. _context-reference:

Structure of a Context
----------------------

``key``
   Name of the context
   whose value you want to query.

``operator``
   Type of test to perform against ``key``'s value.
   Defaults to ``equal``.

``operand``
   The result returned by ``key``
   is tested against this value.

``match_all``
   Requires the test to succeed
   for all selections.
   Defaults to ``false``.


Context Keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Arbitrary keys may be provided by plugins.
Thus, this section only features keys
provided by Sublime Text itself.

``auto_complete_visible``
   Returns ``true``
   if the autocomplete list
   is visible.

``has_next_field``
   Returns ``true``
   if a next snippet field
   is available.

``has_prev_field``
   Returns ``true``
   if a previous snippet field
   is available.
   
``last_command``
   Returns the name of the last command run.

``num_selections``
   Returns the number of selections.

``overlay_visible``
   Returns ``true``
   if any overlay is visible.

``panel_visible``
   Returns ``true``
   if any panel is visible.

``following_text``
   Test against the selected text and the text
   following it until the end of the line.

``preceding_text``
   Test against the text on the line up to and
   including the selection.

``selection_empty``
   Returns ``true``
   if the selection
   is an empty region.

``setting.x``
   Returns the value of the ``x`` setting.
   ``x`` can be any string.

``text``
   Restricts the test
   to the selected text.

``selector``
   Returns the name of the current scope.

``panel_has_focus``
   Returns ``true``
   if a panel
   has input focus.

``panel``
   Returns ``true``
   if the panel given as ``operand``
   is visible.


Context Operators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``equal``, ``not_equal``
   Test for equality.

``regex_match``, ``not_regex_match``
   Match against a regular expression (full match).

``regex_contains``, ``not_regex_contains``
   Match against a regular expression (partial match).



Command Mode
************

Sublime Text provides a ``command_mode`` setting
to prevent key presses
from being sent to the buffer.
This is useful, for example,
to emulate Vim's modal behavior.

Key bindings not intended for command mode
(generally, all of them)
should include a context like this:

.. code-block:: json

    {"key": "setting.command_mode", "operand": false}

This way, plugins legitimately using command mode
will be able to define appropriate key bindings
without interference.


Bindable Keys
*************

Keys in key bindings may be specified
literally or by name.
If using a name doesn't work in your case,
try a literal value.

.. TODO: Check the above.

Here's the list of all valid names:

* ``up``
* ``down``
* ``right``
* ``left``
* ``insert``
* ``home``
* ``end``
* ``pageup``
* ``pagedown``

Modifiers
---------

* ``shift``

Warning about Bindable Keys
---------------------------

If you're developing a package,
keep this in mind:

* ``Ctrl+Alt+<alphanum>`` should never be used in any Windows key bindings.
* ``Option+<alphanum>`` should never be used in any OS X key bindings.

In both cases,
the user's ability
to insert non-ASCII characters
would be compromised otherwise.

End-users are free to remap
any key combination.


Order of Preference for Key Bindings
************************************

Key bindings in a keymap file are evaluated
from the bottom to the top.
The first matching context wins.


Keeping Keymaps Organized
**************************

Sublime Text ships with default keymaps
under ``Packages/Default``.
Other packages may include
keymap files of their own.

The recommended storage location
for your personal keymap files is ``Packages/User``.

See :ref:`merging-and-order-of-precedence`
for more information.


International Keyboards
***********************

Due to the way Sublime Text
maps key names to physical keys,
key names may not correspond to
physical keys in keyboard layouts
other than US English.


Troubleshooting
***************

To enable logging
related to keymaps, see:

   - `sublime.log_commands(flag)`_.
   - `sublime.log_input(flag)`_.

This may help in
debugging keymaps.
