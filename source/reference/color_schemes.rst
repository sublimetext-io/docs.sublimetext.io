Overview
========

Color schemes define the colors
used to highlight source code in Sublime Text views
and to style different elements
found in the editing area:
background, foreground, selection, caret...


File Format
===========

.. include:: /_includes/color_scheme_summary_table.g.txt

The file format of color scheme files
is inherited from Textmate.

.. note::

   Sublime Text uses the ``.tmTheme`` extension for color scheme files
   to maintain compatibility with Textmate.
   Rather confusingly,
   Sublime Text also has a notion
   of a user interface (UI) theme.
   A UI theme is a set of styles and decorations
   to alter the look of the editor's UI.

   It's important to remember
   that UI themes and color schemes
   are two different customization mechanisms.
   Generally speaking, it is far less complex
   to create a new color scheme
   than it is to create a new UI theme.


Where to Store Color Schemes
============================

By convention,
:doc:`packages </extensibility/packages>` primarily containing
a set of color scheme files
have the *Color Scheme -* prefix.
For example: *Color Scheme - Default*.

The file names of all available color schemes
are displayed in the **Preferences â†’ Color Scheme** menu,
grouped by the containing package.


.. _color-scheme-structure:

Structure of a Color Scheme File
================================

All color scheme files share
the same topmost structure.

Colors can be expressed in the
following formats:
``#RRGGBB``, ``#RGB``, `X11 color names`__

.. __: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_color_names

Most elements controlling colors
accept an alpha channel value:
``#RRGGBBAA``.

Sub-elements of Settings
************************

Sublime Text supports
the following color scheme settings:


Global Settings
---------------

Not associated with any scope.
These settings affect global visual items
in the editing area.

Global settings go inside a ``<dict>`` element
within the topmost ``<array>``.

.. code-block:: xml

   <array>
      <dict>
         <key>settings</key>
         <dict>
            <key>background</key>
            <string>#272822</string>
            <key>caret</key>
            <string>#F8F8F0</string>

^^^^^^^

``foreground``
   Default foreground color for the view.

   Because there is no override setting for rulers,
   the only way to change the color of rulers
   is a "hack" further described `here`__.
