There are quite a few things that are not (yet) documented in the official docs,
this section tries to solve this.

.. py:module:: sublime


``sublime`` module
------------------


.. py:class:: Window

    This class represents windows in Sublime Text and provides an interface of
    methods to interact with them. For all available methods, see the
    `official documentation <https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/api_reference.html#sublime.Window>`__.

    .. py:method:: set_layout(layout)

        Changes the tile-based panel layout of view groups.

        :param dict layout: specifies the new layout, see below
        :returns: None

        Expects a dictionary like this::

            {"cols": [float], "rows": [float], "cells": [[int]]}

        where :samp:`[type]` represents a list of *type*.

        **cols**
            A list of the column separators (floating point numbers), should
            start with ``0`` (left) and end with ``1`` (right).

        **rows**
            A list of the row separators (floating point numbers), should start
            with ``0`` (top) and end with ``1`` (bottom).

        **cells**
            A list of cell lists which describe a cell's boundaries each. Cells
            can be imagines as rectangles with the rows and cols specified along
            in this dictionary. Think like this::

                [x1, y1, x2, y2]

            where all values are integers respectively and map to the *cols* and
            *rows* indicies. Thus, a cell with ``[0, 0, 1, 2]`` translates to a
            cell from the top left to the first column and the second row
            separator (in a 2x2 grid this would be bottom center).

        .. note::

            **rows** and **cols** are not tested for boundaries and they are not
            adjusted either. Thus, it is possible to specify values lower than
            ``0`` or higher than ``1`` and Sublime Text will in fact treat them
            accordingly. That means you can crop views or create borders. It is
            not known whether the "background color" of these empty spaces can
            be modified, the default is black. Use at your own risk!

            The order of column or row separators is not checked either. If you,
            for example, use a reversed column list like ``[1, 0.5, 0]`` you
            get to see two black panels. Sublime Text is unusable in this state.

        **Examples**::

            # A 2-column layout with a separator in the middle
            window.set_layout({
                "cols": [0, 0.5, 1],
                "rows": [0, 1],
                "cells": [[0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 2, 1]]
            })

        ::

            # A 2x2 grid layout with all separators in the middle
            window.set_layout({
                "cols": [0, 0.5, 1],
                "rows": [0, 0.5, 1],
                "cells": [[0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 2, 1],
                          [0, 1, 1, 2], [1, 1, 2, 2]]
            })

        ::

            # A 2-column layout with the separator in the middle and the right
            # column being split in half
            window.set_layout({
                "cols": [0, 0.5, 1],
                "rows": [0, 0.5, 1],
                "cells": [[0, 0, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2, 1],
                                        [1, 1, 2, 2]]
            })

.. py:class:: View

    Similar to :py:class:`Window`, this class represents views in Sublime Text
    and provides an interface of methods to interact with them. For all
    available methods, see the
    `official documentation <https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/api_reference.html#sublime.View>`__.

    .. py:method:: match_selector(point, selector)

        Matches the scope at ``point`` against the specified ``selector``.

        :param int point: Point in the view whose scope the selector should be
                          matched against.
        :param str selector: A scope selector.
        :returns bool: Whether the selector matches or not.

        Equivalent to::

            view.score_selector(point, selector) != 0
            # or
            sublime.score_selector(view.scope_name(point), selector) != 0

.. # sublime_plugin docs
.. #############################################################################


.. py:module:: sublime_plugin


``sublime_plugin`` module
-------------------------

.. py:class:: EventListener

    .. py:method:: on_query_completions(view, prefix, locations)

        Called whenever the completion list is requested.

        This accounts for all views and all windows, so in order to provide
        syntax-specific completions you should test the current scope of
        ``locations`` with :py:meth:`~sublime.View.match_selector`.

        **view**
            A :py:class:`~sublime.View` instance for which the completions should
            be made.

        **prefix**
            The text entered so far. This is only until the next word separator.

        **locations**
            Array of points in ``view`` where the completion should be
            inserted. This can be interpreted as the current selection.

            If you want to handle completions that depend on word separator
            characters you need to test each location individually. See
            :ref:`completions-multi-cursor` on how Sublime Text handles
            completions with multiple cursors.

        *Return value*
            Expects two (three) formats for return values:

            1.  :samp:`[[{trigger}, {contents}], ...]`

                A **list** of completions similar to
                :ref:`completions-trigger-based` but without mapping keys.
                *trigger* may use the ``\\t`` description syntax.

                **Note:** In Sublime Text 3, completions may also consist of
                plain strings instead of the trigger-contents-list.

            2.  :samp:`([[{trigger}, {contents}], ...], {flags})`

                Basically the same as above but wrapped in a 2-sized **tuple**.
                The second element, the *flags*, may be a bitwise OR combination
                of these flags:

                ``sublime.INHIBIT_WORD_COMPLETIONS``
                    Prevents Sublime Text from adding its word completions to
                    the completion list after all plugins have been processed.
                    This consists of any word in the current document that is
                    longer than 3 characters.

                ``sublime.INHIBIT_EXPLICIT_COMPLETIONS``
                    Prevents Sublime Text from suggesting entries from
                    ``.sublime-completions`` files.
                    Therefore, with this flag set, it will only show completions
                    that are returned by plugins from their
                    ``on_query_completions`` methods (along with word
                    completions unless the above flag is also set.)

                Flags are shared among all completions, once set by one
                plugin you can not revert them.

            3.  Anything else (e.g. ``None``)

                No effect.

        **Example**:
            See :ref:`plugins-completions-example` for an example on how to use
            this event.
