Syntax Definitions
==================


.. note::

   As of Sublime Text Build 3084,
   a new syntax definition format has been added,
   with the ``.sublime-syntax`` extension.

   It is highly encouraged to be used
   in favor of the legacy format
   described in this document,
   unless compatibility with older versions is desired.

   Documentation is available here:
   https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/syntax.html


Compatibility with Textmate
***************************

Generally, Sublime Text syntax definitions are compatible with Textmate
language files.


File Format
***********

Textmate syntax definitions are Plist files with the ``tmLanguage`` extension.
However, for convenience in this reference document, YAML is shown instead.

Additionally, Sublime Text also understands the ``hidden-tmLanguage`` extension,
which can not be selected by the user but only by set by plugins. "Find in
Files" makes use of this. The downsite is that these can not be included by
import statements in other language definitions.

      match: \\[$<>]

    - name: invalid.illegal.ssraw
      match: '[$<>]'
    ...


``name``
    Descriptive name for the syntax definition. Shows up in the syntax
    definition dropdown menu located in the bottom right of the Sublime Text
    interface. It's usually the name of the programming language or equivalent.

``scopeName``
    Name of the topmost scope for this syntax definition. Either
    ``source.<lang>`` or ``text.<lang>``. Use ``source`` for programming
    languages and ``text`` for markup and everything else.

``fileTypes``
    This is a list of file extensions (without the leading dot). When opening
    files of these types, Sublime Text will automatically activate this syntax
    definition for them. Optional.

``uuid``
    Unique indentifier for this syntax definition. Currently ignored.

``patterns``
    Array of patterns to match against the buffer's text.

``repository``
    Array of patterns abstracted out from the ``patterns`` element. Useful to
    keep the syntax definition tidy as well as for specialized uses like
    recursive patterns or re-using the same pattern. Optional.


The Patterns Array
******************

Elements contained in the ``patterns`` array.

``match``
    Contains the following elements:

    ============    ============================================================
    ``match``       Pattern to search for.
    ``name``        Optional. Scope name to be assigned to matches of ``match``.
    ``comment``     Optional. For information only.
    ``captures``    Optional. Refinement of ``match``. See below.
    ============    ============================================================

    In turn, ``captures`` can contain *n* of the following pairs of elements
    (note that ``0`` refers to the whole match):

    ========      ===============================================
    ``0..n``      Name of the group referenced. Must be a string.
    ``name``      Scope to be assigned to the group.
    ========      ===============================================

    Examples:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # Simple

        - comment: Sequences like \$, \> and \<
          name: constant.character.escape.ssraw
          match: \\[$<>]

        # With captures

        - comment: Tab stops like $1, $2...
          name: keyword.other.ssraw
          match: \$(\d+)
          captures:
            '1': {name: constant.numeric.ssraw}

``include``
    Includes items in the repository, other syntax definitions or the current
    one.

    References:

        =========       ===========================
        $self           The current syntax definition.
        #itemName       itemName in the repository.
        source.js       External syntax definitions.
        =========       ===========================

    Examples:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # Requires presence of DoubleQuotedStrings element in the repository.
        - include: '#DoubleQuotedStrings'

        # Recursively includes the complete current syntax definition.
        - include: $self

        # Includes and external syntax definition.
        - include: source.js

``begin..end``
    Defines a scope potentially spanning multiple lines

    Contains the following elements (only ``begin`` and ``end`` are required):

        =================   ====================================================
        ``name``            Scope name for the content including the markers.
        ``contentName``     Scope name for the content excluding the markers.
        ``begin``           The start marker pattern.
        ``end``             The end marker pattern.
        ``name``            Scope name for the whole region.
        ``beginCaptures``   ``captures`` for ``begin``. See ``captures``.
        ``endCaptures``     ``captures`` for ``end``. See ``captures``.
        ``patterns``        Array of patterns to be matched against the content.
        =================   ====================================================

    Example:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        name: variable.complex.ssraw
        begin: '(\$)(\{)([0-9]+):'
        beginCaptures:
          '1': {name: keyword.other.ssraw}
          '3': {name: constant.numeric.ssraw}
        end: \}
        patterns:
        - include: $self
        - name: support.other.ssraw
          match: .


Repository
**********

Can be referenced from ``patterns`` or from itself in an ``include`` element.
See ``include`` for more information.

The repository can contain the following elements:

.. code-block:: yaml

    repository:

      # Simple elements
      elementName:
        match: some regexp
        name:  some.scope.somelang

      # Complex elements
      otherElementName:
        patterns:
        - match: some regexp
          name:  some.scope.somelang
        - match: other regexp
          name:  some.other.scope.somelang

Examples:

.. code-block:: yaml

    repository:
      numericConstant:
        patterns:
        - name: constant.numeric.double.powershell
          match: \d*(?<!\.)(\.)\d+(d)?(mb|kb|gb)?
          captures:
            '1': {name: support.constant.powershell}
            '2': {name: support.constant.powershell}
            '3': {name: keyword.other.powershell}
        - name: constant.numeric.powershell
          match: (?<!\w)\d+(d)?(mb|kb|gb)?(?!\w)
          captures:
            '1': {name: support.constant.powershell}
            '2': {name: keyword.other.powershell}

      scriptblock:
        name: meta.scriptblock.powershell
        begin: \{
        end: \}
        patterns:
        - include: $self


Escape Sequences
****************

Be sure to escape JSON/XML sequences as needed.

.. EXPLAIN

For YAML, additionally make sure that you didn't unintentionally start a new
scalar by not using quotes for your strings. Examples that **won't work** as
expected::

    match: [aeiou]

    include: #this-is-actually-a-comment

    match: "#"\w+""
