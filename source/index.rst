About
=====

The Sublime Text Unofficial Documentation is a community effort
at documenting the `Sublime Text`_ text editor.
It was started by `Guillermo López-Anglada`_ in 2010
and later joined by `FichteFoll`_ in 2013,
receiving countless contributions by other members of the community
through its entire lifetime.
In 2014, it was backed by a fundraiser
and supported by individuals and Sublime HQ Pty Ltd.

After the the previously hosted version on http://docs.sublimetext.info/ went down
and the maintainer of both the repo and the domain
could not be contacted anymore,
the project was rebooted
under its current domain of https://docs.sublimetext.io/,
which is a fork of the original
under the old more permissive license.
