# Sublime Text Community Documentation

We started this project
to fill the gaps
in the Sublime Text [official documentation][off-docs].

***[Read this guide online for free.][docs]***

You can follow our progress here and
on our public [Trello board][trello].

Huge thanks to [all our backers](./BACKERS.md)
from our [fundraiser in 2014 on BountySource][fundraiser]!


## Contributing

This guide is hosted on _Github Pages_ and
built with [Vitepress][].
We use [Git LFS][] (large file storage)
for larger artifacts
embedded in the guide,
such as videos.

We accept error reports and requests for new content
via our [issue tracker][issues],
and encourage you to send pull requests
(but we cannot guarantee
they will be merged).

**Please follow our style guidelines
as described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).**

This repository includes a `.sublime-project`
with predefined settings and helpful build systems.
