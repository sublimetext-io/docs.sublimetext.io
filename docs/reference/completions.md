: Introduction to the different types of completions
:::

Completions aren't limited to completions files, because other sources
contribute to the completions list (see above).
However, the most explicit way Sublime Text provides you to feed it completions
is by means of `.sublime-completions` files.

This topic only deals with the format of a `.sublime-completions` file.

## File Format

Completions are JSON files with the `.sublime-completions` extension.
Entries in completions files can contain either snippet-like strings or plain
text.

### Example

Here's an example (with HTML completions):

```json
{
    "scope": "text.html - source - meta.tag, punctuation.definition.tag.begin",
    "completions":
    [
        {
            "trigger": "a",
            "contents": "<a href=\"$1\">$0</a>"
        },
        {
            "trigger": "abbr\t<abbr>",
            "contents": "<abbr>$0</abbr>"
        },
        {
            "trigger": "acronym",
            "contents": "<acronym>$0</acronym>"
        }
    ]
}
```

**scope**
: Determines when the completions list will be populated with this list of
  completions.

  See [Scopes][] for more information.

[Scopes]: /guide/extensibility/syntaxdefs.md#scopes

**completions**
: Array of *completions*.

## Types of Completions

### Plain Strings

Plain strings are equivalent to an entry where the `trigger` is identical to the
`contents`:

```json
"foo"
// is equivalent to:
{
    "trigger": "foo",
    "contents": "foo"
}
```

### Trigger-based Completions

```json
{
    "trigger": "foo",
    "contents": "foobar"
},
{   "trigger": "foo\ttest",
    "contents": "foobar"
}
```

**trigger**
: Text that will be displayed in the completions list and will cause the
  `contents` to be inserted when chosen.

  You can use a `\t` tab character to add an *annotation* for the preceding
  trigger.
  The annotation will be displayed right-aligned, slightly grayed and does not
  affect the trigger itself.

**contents**
: Text to be inserted in the buffer.
  Supports the same string interpolation features as snippets.

  Refer to [Snippet Features][].

::: tip
If you want a literal `$`, you have to escape it like this: `\\$`
(double backslashes are needed because we are within a JSON string).
