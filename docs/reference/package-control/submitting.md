# Submitting a package

One of the reasons developers love Sublime Text
is because of the unmatched breadth and quality of the package ecosystem
and community.
Package Control is the community project that helps users find,
install, and update packages.

If you've taken the time to develop a package,
please consider adding it to the default Package Control channel
so users can easily install and keep your package up-to-date.


## Review existing packages

Start by looking for similar packages you might be able to contribute to.

We strongly encourage improving or adding to existing packages.
This means that packages are of higher quality,
and users don't have to choose from several similar options.
We regularly replace packages that have become outdated
with newer implementations.


## Pick a name

Beyond taste there are some technical aspects to keep in mind
when naming your package.
A package is a directory, so the name must be safe for use in that context.
And a package is (often) a Python module,
meaning Python needs to be able to load it properly.
Also think about how users will be able to search for your package:
you don't want users to have to type in special characters or diacritics,
to be able to find it.

Some rules to follow:

- Try not to use the word "Sublime" in your package name.
  Every package available via Package Control is for Sublime Text.
  Using the word Sublime just adds noise to the list
  when trying to find packages.
  You can use the word Sublime in your marketing material
  (README etc.) though of course.
- Don't use a name too similar to another: we don't want Todo and T0d0.
- Don't use snake_case.
  There are minor technical reasons to avoid that,
  but mostly it's just very uncommon (in other words, it looks weird).
- Don't use a `.` in the package name.
  If your package includes any Python code, it will not load in Sublime Text.
  This is because Python uses . as a folder separator when importing code.
- Don't use a `/` or other restricted characters in the package name.
  Invalid characters include:
  `<`, `\>`, `:`, `"`, `/`, `\`, `|`, `?` and `*`.
- Use ASCII only.
- Language support (aka "syntax" or "grammar") packages
  are named after the language it supports,
  without suffixes like "syntax" or "highlighting".

Note that the package name is used in references to resources,
for instance settings files.
If your package name is different from its Git repository name,
make sure you rename the local clone to match.


## Decide how to host

Pick one of the following two hosting options:

- A public GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab repository.
  Only include one package per Git repository
  and be sure the root of the package is the root of the repository.
  Do not include a packages.json file in your repository.
- Host `.sublime-package` files and a `packages.json` on a web server with SSL.
  For each release you'll need to create and upload a new package file
  and update the `packages.json` information.
  Also see the [repository documentation][repo].

When using a public Git repository,
you will need to create a tag each time
you want to make a new version available to users.
The tag names must be a [semantic version number][semver].

If you chose self-hosting,
you will need to use semantic versioning in your `packages.json` file.


## Prepare your Git repository

- Create a [semver-numbered][semver] tag.
- Ensure there are no `.pyc` files in your repository.
- Remove `package-metadata.json`.
  This is automatically generated by Package Control
  when a package is installed
  and should not be in your repository.
- Check file names for cross-platform compatibility,
  the same restricted characters apply as in your package name.
- Under very specific circumstances,
  like including executables or shared libraries,
  add a `.no-sublime-package` file to the root of your repository.
  This file will prevent Package Control from shipping your package
  as a zipped `.sublime-package` file.
  It is not needed for bundling Python modules.
  If a module uses numerous absolute imports
  to import parts of itself
  and an addition to `sys.path` is necessary,
  this also works if the package is archived
  because of Python's internal ziploader.


## Add your Git repository to the default channel

Fork the [Package Control Channel][pcc]. Then:

- For packages hosted on a public GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab URL,
  add your package information to the correct file in the repository directory.
  For full details of the possibilities,
  please refer to the [repository.json documentation][repo].
- For self-hosted packages
  add the URL of your repository JSON file to the `channel.json`
  in the root directory.


## Submit a pull request

Now you're ready to push your changes and make a PR
on the [Package Control Channel][pcc] repository.
Follow any guidelines there and make sure the tests pass!

For a cleaner process,
you should only submit one package per PR.
This allows package submissions to be reviewed and merged independenly.

Note that this is a community project
and people review PRs in their spare time;
it might take a while.

### LSP and SublimeLinter

Plugins for the LSP or SublimeLinter frameworks should be submitted to the repositories where those teams manage related packages:

- Linter packages should be submitted over at [SublimeLinter][sl].
- Similarly, any language server protocol packages
  are managed via [SublimeLSP][lsp].

### Things that help your submission get approved more quickly

- We only accept submissions from maintainers of the package being submitted.
- A valid [semver][] numbered tag must exist on the repository.
- Ensure the README clearly describes the purpose of the package
  and how to use it.
- We strongly advise against adding features to the context menu in most cases,
  because space in this menu is very limited.
  In any case,
  features should apply to the specific context,
  their visibility should be conditional,
  and preferably configurable.
- We strongly advice against adding keybindings by default.
  There aren't enough keys for all packages,
  so you risk overriding those of other packages.
  Instead, provide commented out suggestions in a keymap file,
  and/or explain how to create bindings in your README.
- Ensure preferences and keybindings (if any)
  are listed in the menu and the command palette,
  and open in split view (i.e. using `edit_settings`, not `open_file`).
- Language support packages should not ship with color schemes
  to specifically support the language.
  Please review common [scope names][scopes]
  that will allow any color scheme to support your language.
- Note that the [`git-archive`][arch] feature is used to create the package file,
  meaning you can use [`.gitattributes`][attr] to exclude images and other files
  that have no functionality in the package
  (typically drastically reducing file size of your package
  when images are included in the repository).

### What labels to use

For labels, please follow these recommendations:

- Labels are always in lowercase.
- Packages that provide ...
  - a [language syntax][syntax] have the "language syntax" label.
  - (the colors for) [syntax highlighting][colors]
    have the "color scheme" label,
    whereas packages that provide [theming for the UI][theme]
    have the "theme" label.
  - a [build system][build] have the "build system" label.
  - [snippets][snip] have the "snippets" label.
  - [completion metadata][complete] have the "completions" label.
  - any other kind of auto-complete have the "auto-complete" label.
  - formatters have the "formatting" label,
    and optionally "prettify" or "minify", if appropriate.
  - utilities have the "utilities" label.
