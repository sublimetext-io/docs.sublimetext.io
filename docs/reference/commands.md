## About Paths in Command Arguments
[About Paths in Command Arguments]: #about-paths-in-command-arguments

Some commands take paths as parameters. Among these, some support snippet-like
syntax, while others don't. A command of the first kind would take a parameter
like `${packages}/SomeDir/SomeFile.ext` whereas a command of the second kind
would take a parameter like `Packages/SomeDir/SomeFile.ext`.

Generally, newer commands support the snippet-like syntax.

Commands expect UNIX-style paths if not otherwise noted, including on
Windows (for example, `/c/Program Files/Sublime Text 3/sublime_plugin.py`).

Often, relative paths in arguments to commands are assumed to start at the
:Data_directory:.


<!--  TODO: split into Window and Text (and Application) commands since they behave
- differently and require other call mechanisms when called from a plugin -->


## Commands

### `append`
: Inserts a string at the end of the view.

  - **characters** (String): String to be inserted.
  - **force** (Bool):
  - **scroll_to_end** (Bool):

### `auto_complete`
: Opens the auto complete list.

### `build`
: Runs a build system.
  - **variant** (String): Optional. The name of the variant to be run.

### `clear_bookmarks`
: If no **name** argument, or the **name** "bookmarks" is specified, it
   removes all bookmarks set in the current file, but not the marks. If
   the **name** "mark" is specified as an argument, it removes all marks set
   in the current file, but not the bookmarks.

  - **name** (String): e.g. `"mark"`, `"bookmarks"`.

### `clear_fields`
: Breaks out of the active snippet field cycle.

### `clear_recent_files`
: Deletes records of recently accessed files and folders.

### `clear_recent_projects`
: Deletes records of recently accessed projects.

### `clone_file`
: Clones the current view into the same tab group, both sharing the same
  buffer. That means you can drag one tab to another group and every update to
  one view will be visible in the other one too.

### `close_file`
: Closes the active view and, under certain circumsances, the whole
  application.
<!--   XXX Sounds kinda wrong. -->

### `duplicate_line`
: Duplicates the current line.

### `exec`
: Runs an external process asynchronously. On Windows, GUIs are supressed.

  `exec` is the default command used by build systems, thus it provides
  similar functionality. However, a few options in build systems are taken
  care of by Sublime Text internally so they list below only contains
  parameters accepted by this command.

  - **cmd** [(String)]
  - **shell_cmd** (String): Shell command to use. If given overrides
    `cmd` and ignores `shell`.

  - **encoding** (String)
  - **env** [{String: String}]
  - **quiet** (Bool): If `True` no runtime information is printed if the
    command fails or has a non-zero exit code.
  - **kill** (Bool): If `True` will simply terminate the current build
    process. This is invoked via *Build: Cancel* command from the
    [Command Palette][].
  - **update_phantoms_only** (Bool)
  - **hide_phantoms_only** (Bool)
  - **word_wrap** (Bool): Whether to word-wrap the output in the build panel

## Discovering Commands

There are several ways to discover a command's name in order to use it as a key
binding, in a macro, as a menu entry or in a plugin.

- Browsing the default key bindings at **Preferences | Key Bindings - Default**.
  If you know the key binding whose command you want to inspect, you can just
  search for it using the [search panel][]. This, of course, also works in the
  opposite direction.

[search panel]: /guide/usage/search-and-replace.md

- `sublime.log_commands(True)`

  Running the above in the :console: will tell Sublime Text to print the command's
  name in the console whenever a command is run. You can practically just enter
  this, do whatever is needed to run the command you want to inspect and then
  look at the console. It will also print the passed arguments so you can
  basically get all the information you need from it. When you are done, just
  run the function again with `False` as parameter.

- Inspecting `.sublime-menu` files. If your command is run by a menu item,
  browse the default menu file at `Packages/Default/Main.sublime-menu`.
  You will find them quick enough once you take a look at it, or see the [menu documentation][].

[menu documentation]: ./menus.md

- Similar to menus, you can do exactly the same with `.sublime-command` files.
  See [completions][] for some documentation on completion
  files.

[completions]: ./completions.md
[Goto Anything]: /guide/usage/file-management/navigation.md#goto-anything
[Command Palette]: /guide/extensibility/command_palette.md
