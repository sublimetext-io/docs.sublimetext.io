title: Color Schemes (Legacy)
---

Color schemes define the colors
used to highlight source code in Sublime Text views
and to style different elements
found in the editing area:
background, foreground, selection, caret...


::: warning
This document describes
the old `.tmTheme` color scheme (not theme!) format
inherited from TextMate.

For the new `.sublime-color-scheme` format
added in Sublime Text 3.1,
refer to the [official documentation][].

[official documentation]: https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/color_schemes.html

::: tip Note
Sublime Text differentiates
between "color schemes" defining colors in the editor area
and "themes" defining the layout for the rest of the UI.
Rather confusingly,
the *color scheme* format inherited from TextMate
uses the `.tmTheme` unchanged extension,
because themes in TextMate themes
are what color schemes are for Sublime Text.

It's important to remember
that UI themes and color schemes
are two different customization mechanisms.
Generally speaking, it is far less complex
to create a new color scheme
than it is to create a new UI theme.

## File Format

| Name          | Description                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Format**    | Property List                             |
| **Extension** | `.tmTheme`                                |
| **Name**      | Any                                       |
| **Location**  | Any under `Packages`                      |

The file format of color scheme files
is inherited from Textmate.


## Where to Store Color Schemes

By convention,
[packages][] primarily containing
a set of color scheme files
have the *Color Scheme -* prefix.
For example: *Color Scheme - Default*.

The file names of all available color schemes
are displayed in the **Preferences â†’ Color Scheme** menu,
grouped by the containing package.

[packages]: /guide/extensibility/packages.md

## Structure of a Color Scheme File

All color scheme files share
the same topmost structure.

Colors can be expressed in the
following formats:
`#RRGGBB`, `#RGB`, [X11 color names][]

[X11 color names]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_color_names

Most elements controlling colors
accept an alpha channel value:
`#RRGGBBAA`.

## Sub-elements of Settings

Sublime Text supports
the following color scheme settings:


### Global Settings

Not associated with any scope.
These settings affect global visual items
in the editing area.

Global settings go inside a `<dict>` element
within the topmost `<array>`.

```xml
<array>
   <dict>
      <key>settings</key>
      <dict>
         <key>background</key>
         <string>#272822</string>
         <key>caret</key>
         <string>#F8F8F0</string>
         ...
      </dict>
   </dict>
...
</array>
```

#### General

`foreground`
: Default foreground color for the view.
  Affects file contents, the gutter, rulers and guides.
  The alpha channel does not apply to file contents.
  Because there is no override setting for rulers,
  the only way to change the color of rulers
  is a "hack" further described [on CursorRuler's wiki][hack].

  [hack]: https://github.com/icylace/CursorRuler/wiki/Tips#ruler-colors

`background`
: Default background color of the view (and gutter).

`invisibles`
: Ignored.

## Minimal Scope Coverage

Refer to the [official Scope Naming guidelines]
in order to find out
which scopes a color scheme should cover at minimum.
