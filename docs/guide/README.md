Welcome to the community-driven documentation project
for the Sublime Text editor!

[Sublime Text][] is a versatile, fun, and fast text editor
for code and prose that automates repetitive tasks
so you can focus the important stuff.
It supports on macOS, Windows and Linux.
Its versatility comes from
a wide range of community-developed third-party packages
that provide syntax highlighting, snippets,
or other automation backed by [Python][] plugins.
The default distribution of Sublime Text
aims to provide a basic but very functional set of features,
but it can easily be turned into a full-fledged IDE,
if so desired.

In this guide,
you will learn how to use Sublime Text effectively
and how to extend it
with functionality that caters to your workflow.

If you're starting out with Sublime Text
and already installed it,
we recommend beginning with the [Basic Concepts][] page.
Otherwise,
feel free to use the sidebar on the left
to navigate to your topic of interest.

If you're interested in the nitty-gritty details
of how you can customize and extend Sublime Text to your liking,
check out the [Reference](/reference/) section
of this guide via the navigation bar on top.
You can always go back to this page
by clicking on "Guide" in that same bar.

**Happy learning!**

::: tip One last note before you dive in
You can switch the page's theme by using the cog in the top navigation bar.
Changing the theme and using the search bar require JavaScript,
because this is a statically hosted site.
Other than that, this site site can be used without JavaScript.

## History

The Unofficial Sublime Text Documentation
was started by [Guillermo López-Anglada](https://github.com/guillermooo) in 2010
and later joined by [FichteFoll](https://github.com/FichteFoll) in 2013,
receiving countless contributions
by other members of the community through its entire lifetime.
In 2014, it was backed by a fundraiser
and supported by individuals and Sublime HQ Pty Ltd.

After that version of the docs,
originally hosted on http://docs.sublimetext.info/,
went down in September 2019
and the maintainer of both the repo and the domain
could not be contacted anymore,
the project was
forked of the original
under an older, more permissive license
and rebooted at its current domain of <https://docs.sublimetext.io/>.
In the process,
the underlying markup rendering framework was changed
from [Sphinx][] to [Vuepress][]
and the documents have been restructured
into the two guide and reference main sections
you can see in the navigation bar at the top.

[Sphinx]: https://sphinx-doc.org/
