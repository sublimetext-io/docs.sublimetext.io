The Sublime Text Community Documentation is a community effort at documenting
the [Sublime Text][] text editor and accompanying its
[official documentation][].

[Sublime Text]: https://sublimetext.com/
[official documentation]: https://sublimetext.com/docs/

::: tip Notice
This documentation is currently undergoing updates and modifications.

## Layout

The documentation is split into two sections:

1. [**The Guide**](/guide/).

   Includes basic information on Sublime Text, covers its usage and how it can
   be customized.

2. [**The Reference**](/reference/).
   *(For experienced users.)*

   This is where you can look up (almost) all the details you need to know about
   how to structure your custom key bindings or how to disable a menu item for
   your plugin.

<!-- TODO mention FAQ, once filled -->
