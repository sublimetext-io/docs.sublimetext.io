The Sublime Text Community Documentation 
is a community effort 
at documenting the [Sublime Text][] text editor
and accompanying its [official documentation][].

[Sublime Text]: https://sublimetext.com/
[official documentation]: https://sublimetext.com/docs/3/


## Layout

The documentation is split into two sections:

1. **[The Guide](/guide/)**.

   Includes basic information on Sublime Text,
   covers its usage
   and how it can be customized.

2. **[The Reference](/reference/)**.
   *(For experienced users.)*

   This is where you can look up
   (almost) all the details you need to know
   about how to structure your custom key bindings
   or how to disable a menu item for your plugin.

<!-- TODO mention FAQ, once filled -->
